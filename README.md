specs2-runner
=============

This is a Specs2 extension for the ScalaTest plug-in for ScalaIDE.

Specs 2 is a redesigned version of Specs using functional components (see [a great introduction](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMyNRUuEvNU) by Eric Torreborre).

Building on your own
--------------------

It is a simple Sbt project, you can buid it by the following command:

	$ sbt package

You can find the generated Jar file in the `target` folder.

Importing the project into Eclipse
----------------------------------

First, you need to [install sbteclipse][sbteclipse], it requires sbt 0.11.3 at least.

Then generate the required `.project` and `.classpath` files for Eclipse by the following command:

	$ sbt eclipse
	[info] Loading global plugins from ...
	[info] Set current project to specs2-runner 
	[info] About to create Eclipse project files for your project(s).

	[info] Done updating.

Note that the generated files contain absolute paths, that is the reason why they got ignored in the `.gitignore` file.
